# Welcome to LigerMobile Android

Most of our documentation is available through the main
[ LigerMobile project ]( https://github.com/reachlocal/liger ).
However, we've jotted a few notes here that are pertinent to this
specific part of the project. This project contains the LigerMobile android
library code, the LigerMobile test app, and a build for the LigerMobile
workshop application that it references from an outside directory.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reachlocal/liger-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reachlocal/liger-android)

## Getting Started

This project depends on you also checking out the [Ligermobile
workshop](https://github.com/reachlocal/ligermobile-workshop/) project in a
directory that is at the same level as this project. To be sure you have
everything you need, check out the following:

1. Open a terminal window
1. We recommend you start with a new, clean directory:
    mkdir ligermobile
1. Change to that directory:
    cd ligermobile
1. Check out this project:
    git clone git@github.com:reachlocal/liger-android.git
1. Check out the ligermobile-workshop project
    git@github.com:reachlocal/ligermobile-workshop.git
1. Now, you are able to follow the [getting started for android on
   mac](https://github.com/reachlocal/liger/blob/master/tutorials/1-getting-started-mac-android.md)
   instructions.

Once everything is set up properly, you will find that you can run two
configurations:
* liger-android-bbcdemo
* liger-android-test-app
